 <p>Designing websites has been a long passion of mine. Growing up online, I became fascinated with almost everything digital. I began making websites in 1996, when I was 13 years old.</p>
 <p>Since then I have been a prolific web designer and an avid web coder. Aesthetically, I prefer simple, elegant and uncluttered designs. On the backend, I strive to make clean and valid code, compatible with most browsers and resolutions.</p>
 <h3>My primary skills and expertise are:</h3>
