<p>Hello World is a computer program created by a programmer for specific programming language to provide output Hello World on the screen of the device to make sure the setup was correct. PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, a scripting programming language (interpreter) that are widely used for the general purpose and highly suited for Web development as it can be inserted into HTML document.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, and which I understand about PHP, PHP is an interpreter, where a command is executed directly without the need for the compilation (compiling). Due to this the process of developing an application with php faster, and easy to learn because php is compiled-in with many features and has the extension. For more details about the programming language Interpreted please ask google. Here's an example script / listings / syntax Hello World / Hello World in php:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/paymycoffee/5845298.js"></script>
<p>The above example will produce the output:</p>
<pre style="background:#000;color:#fff">Hello World</pre>
<p>It's Easy isn't it, now try the C programming language:</p>
<p>For the above Example do not forget to compile it first :)</p>
<p>Now try to make use PHP GD image (in windows php_gd.dll, in unix php_gd.so)</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/paymycoffee/5845420.js"></script>
<p>The above example will produce the output:</p>
<pre>Halo Dunia</pre>
<p>For example the C programming language please also ask google it will a bit long time to take after I think about it again :)</p>
<p>Conclusions from the above explanation is very easy to learn php and php development process can be very fast, but you can get faster data processes by understanding the process of compiling the C programming This is caused already packed with features in PHP that may not be commonly used or not used at all.</p>
